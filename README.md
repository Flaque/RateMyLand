### Installing dependencies (Woah! Much Fun! Such Easy!)

1. Node.js
You may already have this. To test, open up Terminal or CMD and type in "npm".

If not, you'll need to install if by following the [install here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. Sass

I'll add this later.

3. Webpack
Cool! Now that you have Node, installing everything else should be easy.
Type this in your CMD or Terminal
```bash
npm install webpack -g
```
